                      that are defined in the CCPA have the same meaning given

                    <p>
                      The CCPA provides individuals residing in California or

                      The below describes your rights and how you may exercise
                      them.

                      You can request that Iron Hills disclose certain
                      information to you about our collection and use of your
                      personal information over the past twelve (12) months.
                      Once Iron Hills receives and confirms your verifiable
                      information access request, Iron Hills must disclose to
                      you: (i) the categories of personal information we
                      collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources for
                      the personal information we collected about you; (iii) our
                      business or commercial purpose for collecting or, if
                      applicable, selling that personal information; (iv) the
                      categories of third parties with whom we share that
                      personal information; (v) the specific data points or
                      pieces of personal information we collected about you. If
                      we disclosed for a business purpose or sold your personal
                      information, Iron Hills must also provide separate lists
                      that: identify the personal information categories that
                      were sold to each category of recipient in connection with
                      sales of your personal information; and identify the
                      personal information categories that were provided to each
                      category of recipient in connection with business purposes
                      disclosures of your personal information.

                    <p>Deletion Request Rights</p>
                    <p>
                      You can request that Iron Hills delete any of your
                      personal information that we collected from you and/or
                      retained. Unless subject to a certain limited exception,
                      once Iron Hills receives and confirms your verifiable data
                      deletion request, we may delete (and direct our service
                      providers to delete) your personal information from our
                      records. Iron Hills will notify you promptly if it
                      determines it must deny your deletion request.

                    <p>Do Not Sell Opt-Out Rights</p>
                    <p>
                      You have the right to opt-out of any sales, as defined by

                    <p>Exercising Your Rights</p>
                    <p>
                      To exercise your access, data portability, and deletion or
                      do not sell opt-out rights described above, you may submit
                      a verifiable consumer request by email to
                      contact@ironhills.io.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>
                      You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access
                      or data portability up to two times within a 12-month
                      period. You may make a verifiable do not sell opt-out
                      request at any time. Any such request must: (i) provide
                      sufficient information that allows Us to reasonably verify
                      that you are the person about whom we collected personal
                      information or an authorized representative thereof; and
                      (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail such
                      that we may understand, evaluate, and respond to it. Iron
                      Hills cannot respond to your request or provide you with
                      personal information if we cannot verify your identity or
                      authority to make the request and confirm the personal
                      information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer
                      request does not require you to create an account with
                      Iron Hills. Iron Hills will only use personal information
                      provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
                      requestor&rsquo;s identity or authority to make the
                      request. Only you or a person registered with the
                      California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on
                      your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related
                      to your personal information.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Response Timing And Format</p>
                    <p>
                      We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request
                      within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up
                      to 90 days), we will inform you in writing of the
                      extension period and the reason for it. Iron Hills will
                      deliver any required or requested responses or other
                      communications in writing to you by email. Any disclosures
                      we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding
                      the verifiable consumer request&rsquo;s receipt. If
                      applicable, the response we provide will also explain any
                      reasons we cannot comply with a request. For data
                      portability requests, Iron Hills will provide your
                      personal information in a format that is readily usable
                      and transferable. Iron Hills does not charge a fee to
                      process or respond to your verifiable consumer request
                      unless such requests become excessive, repetitive, or
                      manifestly unfounded or as otherwise permitted by the
                      CCPA. If we determine that a request warrants charging a
                      fee, we will notify you and provide you with a cost
                      estimate before completing your request.
