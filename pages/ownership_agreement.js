                          documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will

                          statement of reasons unless requested by either Party.
                          The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any
                          award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do
                          so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable
                          AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take
                          place in Howard County, Maryland. Except as otherwise

                      9. Severability. If for any reason a court of competent
                      jurisdiction finds that any provisions, or portion
                      thereof, of these Terms are unenforceable, that provision
                      shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible by
                      law, and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in
                      full force and effect.{" "}

                      10. Changes To These Terms. Iron Hills, in its sole
                      discretion, reserves the right to change these Terms at
                      any time. Any and all changes will take effect immediately
                      upon posting via the Site.{" "}

                      11. No Waiver. Any failure by Iron Hills to enforce any
                      right or term of these Terms will not be considered a
                      waiver of such right or term. The waiver of any such right
                      or term will be effective only if in writing and signed by
                      a duly authorized representative of Iron Hills. Except as
                      expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either
                      party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be
                      without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms
                      or otherwise.
